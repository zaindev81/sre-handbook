# GKE

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a **managed Kubernetes service** provided by **Google Cloud**. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications by automating the operational overhead of running a Kubernetes cluster.

Essentially, GKE runs the open-source **Kubernetes** platform for you, managing the control plane (the "brain" of the cluster) and providing features to manage the worker nodes and your workloads more easily.

## Key Features and Benefits of GKE üõ†Ô∏è

GKE offers several advantages over running a self-managed Kubernetes cluster:

* **Managed Control Plane:** Google handles the maintenance, upgrades, patching, and scaling of the Kubernetes control plane (master nodes), reducing your operational burden.
* **Automatic Scaling:** GKE provides **four-way autoscaling** (Horizontal Pod, Vertical Pod, Node, and Cluster Autoscaling) to automatically adjust the number of pods and the size/quantity of the underlying virtual machines (nodes) based on real-time application demands.
* **High Availability and Reliability:** It supports **regional clusters** for multi-zone resilience and features like **auto-repair** to replace unhealthy nodes, ensuring your applications remain highly available.
* **Deep GCP Integration:** GKE integrates seamlessly with other Google Cloud services like Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and advanced networking and security tools.
* **Enhanced Security:** It includes built-in security features such as **Workload Identity**, **GKE Sandbox** for runtime isolation, **Binary Authorization** to enforce image signing, and automatic security updates.

## GKE Modes of Operation: Autopilot vs. Standard

GKE offers two primary modes of operation, giving you a choice in how much control and operational responsibility you want for the cluster's worker nodes:

| Feature | GKE Autopilot (Recommended for most) | GKE Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Node Management** | **Fully managed by GKE.** Google handles node provisioning, scaling, upgrading, and patching. You focus only on your workloads. | **User-managed.** You are responsible for configuring, managing, and optimizing the worker nodes and node pools. |
| **Pricing Model** | **Pay-per-Pod.** You are billed only for the resources (CPU, memory, storage) that your *running Pods request*. Control plane costs are included. | **Pay-per-Node (VM).** You are billed for the underlying VM instances (nodes) in your node pools, regardless of actual resource utilization by your Pods. |
| **Flexibility & Control** | **Less flexibility.** Configurations are pre-set based on Google's best practices, and you can't SSH into the nodes or run privileged containers. | **Maximum flexibility.** You have granular control over machine types, node OS, scheduling, and using specialized hardware like custom VMs, GPUs, and TPUs. |
| **Operational Overhead** | **Minimal.** The lowest operational overhead, ideal for teams that want a "serverless Kubernetes" experience. | **High.** Requires active management, capacity planning, and optimization of the node infrastructure. |
| **Use Case** | General-purpose applications, variable workloads, new projects, and teams prioritizing velocity over fine-tuning. | Workloads with specific hardware or OS requirements, custom networking needs, or expert teams focused on aggressive cost-tuning and performance optimization. |
