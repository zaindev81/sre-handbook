## üß≠ 1. **What is Zipkin?**

**Zipkin** is an **open-source distributed tracing system** created by Twitter.
It helps **trace requests across microservices**, so you can see **where latency occurs** in your system.

It focuses **only on tracing**, unlike OpenTelemetry, which supports **traces, metrics, and logs**.

### üß© 2. **How Zipkin Works**

When a user request travels through multiple services:

```
Frontend ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Order Service ‚Üí Payment Service ‚Üí Database
```

Zipkin:

* Collects **spans** from each service (each span = one operation)
* Groups them into a **trace**
* Stores them in a **backend (e.g., MySQL, Elasticsearch, or in-memory)**
* Displays them in a **web UI**, showing a timeline of each request

```

### üîß 4. **How It‚Äôs Used**

* Developers instrument their apps using **Zipkin SDKs** (or compatible libraries like Brave for Java, OpenTelemetry exporters, etc.)
* Apps send trace data to the **Zipkin collector** (via HTTP or Kafka)
* Zipkin stores traces and visualizes them in its **UI dashboard**

---

### üìä 5. **Example Use Case**

You have a slow API.
With Zipkin, you can:

* See how long each microservice call took
* Find which service caused the delay
* Filter by trace ID, service name, or duration
* Visualize dependencies between services

## üîç 6. **Zipkin vs. OpenTelemetry**

| Feature            | **Zipkin**                       | **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**          | Tracing only                     | Tracing, Metrics, Logs                       |
| **Role**           | Tracing backend (collector + UI) | Instrumentation + data pipeline              |
| **Collector**      | Built-in                         | Dedicated OTel Collector                     |
| **Integration**    | Limited                          | Works with Jaeger, Prometheus, Datadog, etc. |
| **UI**             | Has built-in web UI              | No UI (sends data to external tools)         |
| **Standard**       | Zipkin format                    | OpenTelemetry standard (superset)            |
| **Adoption trend** | Mature, legacy systems           | Modern standard, CNCF-backed                 |

---

### üí° 7. **Modern Use Together**

OpenTelemetry can **export data to Zipkin**.
That means you can **instrument apps using OpenTelemetry SDKs**, but **visualize traces in Zipkin**.

```text
[App with OTel SDK] ‚Üí [OTel Collector ‚Üí Zipkin Exporter] ‚Üí [Zipkin UI]
```

So, if your organization already uses Zipkin, you can **gradually migrate** to OpenTelemetry without losing compatibility.

### ‚úÖ 8. **Summary**

| You should use...                                 | When...                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zipkin**                                        | You only need tracing and want a simple, self-hosted UI.   |
| **OpenTelemetry + Zipkin**                        | You want flexible instrumentation but still use Zipkin UI. |
| **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger / Prometheus / Grafana** | You want full observability (traces, metrics, logs).       |

Would you like me to show a **diagram** of how OpenTelemetry exports traces to Zipkin in a microservices environment?
