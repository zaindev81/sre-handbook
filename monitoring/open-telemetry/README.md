# Open Telemetry

**OpenTelemetry (OTel)** is an **open-source observability framework** that helps developers collect, process, and export **metrics, logs, and traces** from applications and infrastructure in a **vendor-neutral** way. It‚Äôs a unified standard supported by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** and widely used with tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Datadog**.

---

### üß© 1. **Purpose**

OpenTelemetry allows you to:

* **Trace requests** as they flow through distributed systems (for debugging and performance analysis)
* **Collect metrics** like CPU, memory, latency, and throughput
* **Gather logs** to understand application behavior and context
* Send this data to **backends** such as Jaeger, Zipkin, Prometheus, or OpenSearch

It gives you a **standardized instrumentation SDK** so you don‚Äôt have to rewrite code for each monitoring vendor.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Core Components**

| Component                     | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**                       | Defines *what* data can be collected (traces, metrics, logs).                                     |
| **SDK**                       | Implements *how* data is collected, processed, and exported.                                      |
| **Collector**                 | A standalone service that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data to your chosen backend. |
| **Instrumentation Libraries** | Provide ready-made integrations for frameworks (e.g., Express.js, Spring Boot, Flask).            |

### üîç 3. **Tracing Example**

Suppose a user request goes through:

1. **Frontend Service ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Payment Service ‚Üí Database**

With OpenTelemetry tracing, you can:

* See how long each step took
* Identify where errors or bottlenecks occur
* View the full **trace** in tools like Jaeger or Zipkin

Each trace is made of **spans** ‚Äî individual units of work (like ‚Äúquery DB‚Äù or ‚Äúsend email‚Äù).

---

### üìä 4. **Metrics Example**

You can use OTel to collect:

* Request latency
* Error rate
* Memory usage
* Custom business metrics (e.g., number of successful payments)

These can then be sent to **Prometheus** or **Grafana Cloud** for visualization and alerting.

### üß† 5. **Collector Pipeline Example**

```text
[Application SDKs]
    ‚Üì
[OpenTelemetry Collector (Receivers ‚Üí Processors ‚Üí Exporters)]
    ‚Üì
[Jaeger / Prometheus / Grafana / Datadog]
```

You can deploy the collector as a **sidecar**, **agent**, or **centralized service** in Kubernetes or VMs.

---

### üåê 6. **Integrations**

* **Kubernetes** monitoring: integrates with Prometheus, Fluent Bit, and Grafana.
* **Languages supported:** Go, Java, Python, Node.js, .NET, Rust, PHP, Ruby.
* **Cloud providers:** GCP, AWS, Azure all support OTel natively.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Why Use OpenTelemetry**

* Vendor-neutral and future-proof.
* Works across **metrics, logs, and traces** in one ecosystem.
* Supported by major observability platforms.
* Enables **distributed tracing** across microservices.

Would you like me to show an **example setup for OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes** (using Collector + Jaeger)?
