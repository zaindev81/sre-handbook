# Grafana

## üß≠ 1. **What is Grafana?**

**Grafana** is an **open-source observability and visualization platform**.
It lets you **visualize, explore, and alert on data** from many sources ‚Äî such as **Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Zipkin, Jaeger**, and **OpenTelemetry**.

So while OpenTelemetry **collects and exports** data, **Grafana displays and analyzes** it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Grafana‚Äôs Observability Stack**

Grafana offers a full-stack observability suite called the **Grafana Stack** (formerly Loki Stack):

| Component              | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grafana**            | Visualization and dashboards                     |
| **Prometheus / Mimir** | Metrics storage                                  |
| **Loki**               | Log aggregation                                  |
| **Tempo**              | Distributed tracing                              |
| **Alloy (Agent)**      | Data collection (can receive OpenTelemetry data) |

Together, they provide **metrics + logs + traces** ‚Äî the three pillars of observability.

## üß© 3. **How It Works with OpenTelemetry**

OpenTelemetry is responsible for **collecting telemetry data** (from your apps).
Grafana is responsible for **storing, correlating, and visualizing** it.

Example pipeline:

```text
[Application SDKs (OpenTelemetry)]
    ‚Üì
[OpenTelemetry Collector]
    ‚Üì
[Exporters ‚Üí Grafana Backend]
    ‚îú‚îÄ Prometheus/Mimir (metrics)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Loki (logs)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Tempo (traces)
    ‚Üì
[Grafana UI dashboards]
```

This setup gives you a single dashboard to analyze performance, errors, and dependencies across your entire system.

## üîç 4. **Grafana Tempo (Tracing Backend)**

**Tempo** is Grafana‚Äôs distributed tracing backend ‚Äî similar to **Jaeger** or **Zipkin**.

* It **stores and queries traces**.
* It‚Äôs **fully compatible with OpenTelemetry**.
* It integrates natively with **Grafana dashboards**, so you can click a metric spike and instantly view the related traces and logs.

You can even switch Zipkin or Jaeger to Tempo easily ‚Äî it accepts the same protocols.

---

### Example Visualization Flow

1. You notice high latency in your Grafana dashboard (Prometheus metric).
2. Click the spike ‚Üí it links to related **Tempo traces**.
3. Open one trace ‚Üí it shows spans from OpenTelemetry.
4. Click a span ‚Üí view corresponding **Loki logs** for that request.

This ‚Äú**metrics ‚Üí traces ‚Üí logs**‚Äù workflow is why Grafana is so powerful.

| **Zipkin**        | Tracing backend                        | Traces only               | ‚úÖ Built-in UI              | Simple tracing        |
| **Grafana**       | Visualization platform                 | Metrics, logs, traces     | ‚úÖ Advanced dashboards      | Unified observability |
| **Grafana Tempo** | Tracing backend (within Grafana stack) | Traces                    | üîó Integrated with Grafana | Full OTel integration |

---

## üöÄ 6. **Why Many SREs Use Grafana with OpenTelemetry**

* Unified **metrics/logs/traces correlation**
* **Custom dashboards** for SLOs, uptime, and latency
* **Alerting and notification rules**
* **Integrates easily** with Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry Collector
* Open source, but can scale with **Grafana Cloud**
