# Deployment Manager

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service** that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. It allows you to use declarative configurations to define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Deployment Manager takes care of provisioning, updating, and deleting those resources.

## Core Concepts and Features

Deployment Manager is a native GCP tool that enables you to manage your infrastructure using files, which is key to the IaC paradigm.

### Configuration
A **Configuration** is a **YAML** file that describes all the resources you want for a single deployment. It specifies the **type** and **properties** of each resource.

### Templates
For complex deployments, you can break your configuration into reusable **Templates**, which are separate files written in **Python** or **Jinja2**. This provides the flexibility to use a full-fledged programming language for dynamic configuration logic.

### Deployment and Manifest
* A **Deployment** is the collection of Google Cloud resources created based on a configuration.
* A **Manifest** is a read-only object generated by Deployment Manager. It contains the original configuration and the **fully-expanded** list of all resources and properties that were created.

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Define your infrastructure in code (YAML, Python, Jinja2) for version control and automated deployments. |
| **Automated Provisioning** | Automates the creation, modification, and deletion of a wide variety of GCP resources (e.g., Compute Engine VMs, Cloud SQL, networking components). |
| **Declarative Language** | You specify the **resources you want**, not the step-by-step process of how to create them. |
| **Reusable Templates** | Use templates across different deployments to ensure consistency and repeatability. |
| **No Additional Cost** | You only pay for the Google Cloud resources that are provisioned; Deployment Manager itself is a free service. |

## Deployment Manager vs. Terraform

Both Google Cloud Deployment Manager and **HashiCorp Terraform** are popular IaC tools for managing GCP resources. The choice often depends on your cloud strategy and technical requirements.

| Aspect | Google Cloud Deployment Manager (DM) | HashiCorp Terraform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Scope** | **GCP-specific** (Native to Google Cloud). | **Multi-cloud** (Supports all major cloud providers via providers). |
| **Language** | YAML configuration, with templates in **Python** or **Jinja2**. | **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**. |
| **Custom Logic** | Highly flexible due to support for **Python** templates, allowing for complex, custom logic. | Less flexible for complex custom logic, generally requires external scripts or custom providers in Go. |
| **State Management** | **Hosted state** (state is managed by the GCP service). | **Local or Remote State** (requires explicit setup, e.g., in a Cloud Storage bucket). |
| **Maturity** | A mature tool, though some newer GCP services may see initial support lag. | Generally more established and widely adopted in the broader IaC community. |

In short, Deployment Manager is the **GCP-native** IaC tool, offering deep integration and powerful templating with Python. Terraform is the industry-standard **multi-cloud** tool, providing a unified approach across different cloud platforms.

If you are 100% committed to GCP and require the advanced programming logic offered by Python templates, Deployment Manager is a strong candidate. However, for hybrid or multi-cloud environments, or a broader set of community resources, Terraform is typically the recommended choice, and Google provides tools like **DM Convert** to help migrate from Deployment Manager configurations to Terraform.

The video below discusses the Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager, which is Google's managed Terraform service. [Google Cloud infrastructure Manager - Managed Terraform Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM611eyKw7E) This video is relevant because it discusses Google's newer approach to managing infrastructure as code on GCP, which uses a managed version of Terraform, a key competitor and alternative to Deployment Manager.
